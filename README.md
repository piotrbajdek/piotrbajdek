Hi, I'm a Rust programmer mostly interested in developing software for linguistics and biological sciences.<br/>
I'm particularly fond of mid-level programming languages and Unix-like operating systems.<br/>
My most important projects are <a href="https://github.com/piotrbajdek/lngcnv">lngcnv</a> (linguistic) and <a href="https://github.com/piotrbajdek/coprosize">coprosize</a> (scientific).<br/>
